# Application Workflow

This document describes the main workflows and user flows in the Denarly application.

## User Registration and Authentication

### Registration Flow

```
1. User visits registration page
2. User enters:
   - Email address
   - Password (min 8 characters)
   - Full name (optional)
   - Workspace name
3. System creates:
   - User account with hashed password
   - Workspace with user as owner
   - Default "General" budget account
   - workspace_members entry (owner role)
4. System returns JWT access token
5. User is redirected to dashboard
```

### Login Flow

```
1. User visits login page
2. User enters email and password
3. System validates credentials against bcrypt hash
4. System returns JWT access token (valid for 60 minutes)
5. Token stored in localStorage
6. User redirected to dashboard
```

### Protected Access Flow

```
1. Frontend adds Authorization header to all API requests
2. Backend validates JWT token on each request
3. If token invalid/expired → 401 response
4. Frontend interceptor catches 401 → clears token → redirects to login
```

## Budget Management Workflow

### Setting Up a Budget Period

```
1. User navigates to Budget Periods page
2. User creates new period:
   - Name (e.g., "January 2025")

   - Budget account assignment
3. User creates categories for the period:
   - Food, Transport, Utilities, Entertainment, etc.
4. User sets budget amounts per category:
   - Category selection
   - Currency selection
   - Budget amount
5. Period is ready for tracking
```

### Copy Period Workflow

```

```

### Transaction Validation

```
Income transactions:

   - Sums all exchange inflows
   - Sums all exchange outflows
3. Closing balance = opening + income - expenses + exchanges_in - exchanges_out
```

### Opening Balance Carryover

```
