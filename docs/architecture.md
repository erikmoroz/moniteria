# System Architecture

This document describes the high-level architecture, data model, and system components
of Owlgarth Finances after the account-based domain redesign.

## System Overview

Full-stack web application with:
- **Frontend**: React 19 SPA (Vite, TypeScript, TanStack Query)
- **Backend**: Django 6 + Django Ninja REST API
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 17
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Task Queue**: Celery with Redis broker (planned-transaction execution, receipt extraction)
- **Object storage**: S3-compatible (private media bucket for receipt attachments)
- **Receipt parser** (optional): an external, pluggable service implementing `docs/parser-contract.md`

## Data Model

Money-holding **accounts** are the centre of gravity. Budgets *plan* money; accounts
*hold* it. Balances and periods are **computed/derived**, never stored as mutable rows.

```
Workspace (top-level container)
│
├── WorkspaceMember          (user access + role)
├── WorkspaceCurrency        (which catalog currencies are enabled here; stored
│                             position orders them - first = workspace primary)
│
├── Account                  (cash / bank / other; holds money in one currency)
│     ├── Transaction        (income / expense / adjustment; optional category; optionally on this
│     │     │                  account - every transaction stores its own currency, so account-less
│     │     │                  rows hang directly off the workspace)
│     │     ├── TransactionItem        (ordered receipt line items - informational)
│     │     └── TransactionAttachment  (receipt image/PDF in private storage)
│     ├── Transfer           (money moved between two accounts; replaces exchanges)
│     └── PlannedTransaction (scheduled future transaction, optionally on this
│                               account - stores its own currency, equal to the
│                               account's whenever one is set)
│
└── Budget                   (a plan with a cadence)
      ├── BudgetCurrency     (the budget's ordered currency set; first = default view)
      ├── Category           (persistent, budget-scoped)
      └── Period             (derived from cadence, or an explicit custom range)
            └── CategoryBudget (planned amount per category, per period)
```

### Key principles

| Concept | Rule |
|---------|------|
| **Account balance** | Computed: `opening_balance + Σ(transactions) ± Σ(transfers)`. Never stored. |
| **Currency** | A global ISO 4217 catalog; each workspace enables a subset, ordered by a user-reorderable position (first = primary). A transaction stores its own currency - it equals the account's currency whenever an account is set, and account-less rows carry their own (cash exchanged while traveling; a closed account's history). A budget picks an ordered currency set from the enabled subset (`BudgetCurrency`, first = default view). |
| **Default account** | An account may be flagged the default for its currency - at most one per `(workspace, currency)`, enforced by a partial-unique constraint (`one_default_account_per_currency`). It drives account auto-selection when a parsed receipt's currency is known. |
| **Periods** | Derived from a budget's cadence (monthly / every-N-weeks) and materialized on demand - not a table of pre-created rows. Custom-cadence budgets skip derivation: their periods are explicit, non-overlapping, user-defined ranges (admin-managed). |
| **Transfers** | Replace the old currency-exchange records. Cross-currency transfers carry both amounts + an implied rate. |
| **Original-amount facet** | A transaction may record what was actually paid in another currency (converted card payments); informational, excluded from aggregates, and must differ from the transaction's own currency. |
| **Adjustments** | A transaction type that reconciles a balance to a target ("Set balance"); excluded from income/expense totals. |
| **Attachments** | Receipt bytes live in a private S3 bucket; rows hold metadata; downloads stream through the authenticated API (short-lived signed URLs remain for the Django admin only). |

### Multi-Workspace Support

- **Creation**: `POST /api/workspaces` creates a workspace, enables the
  currency set (the chosen currency silently plus EUR/USD by default, or
  exactly an explicit `currency_codes` list, first = primary), and seeds a
  "Main" account (flagged as the default for its currency) + a "General"
  budget (currency set = the primary). Registration can optionally add
  sample data.
- **Switching**: `POST /api/workspaces/{id}/switch` changes the active workspace.
- **Deletion**: `DELETE /api/workspaces/{id}` removes a workspace and all its data
  (owner only), in PROTECT-safe dependency order.

All workspace-scoped endpoints use `WorkspaceJWTAuth`, which validates the user has an
active workspace.

```

Each app with business logic has a `services.py`; `api.py` files are thin request
parsers that delegate to services. Apps with async work have a `tasks.py`.

### Async Task Flows

**Planned transaction execution** - the service sets `status='done'` + `payment_date`
and dispatches `execute_planned_transaction.delay(id)`; the create path defers the
dispatch to `on_commit`, so the message publishes only after the outermost transaction
commits (never at a savepoint release - a worker that beat the commit would find no row
and skip permanently). The worker re-fetches with `select_for_update()`, guards
idempotency via `transaction_id`, and creates the `Transaction` with the plan's account
(possibly none) and the plan's own currency.

**Receipt extraction** - `POST .../attachments/{id}/extract` marks the attachment
`pending` and dispatches `extract_attachment.delay(id)`. The worker reads the stored
file, calls the parser's `/parse`, and records `done` + the contract result or a
retryable `failed` + error. It never raises, so manual work is never blocked. The UI
polls `GET .../extraction`.

### Authentication Layers

1. **JWT token** validates user identity.
2. **Workspace membership** verifies access to the active workspace.
3. **Role permission** - `ADMIN_ROLES` (owner/admin) gate accounts, budgets, and
   currencies; `WRITE_ROLES` (owner/admin/member) gate day-to-day records.
4. **Resource ownership** - every query is workspace-scoped.

On top of these layers, the public auth endpoints (register, login, verify-2fa) are
rate-limited and return `429` when exceeded - per IP **and** per account (login email,
registration email, 2FA user), so rotating source IPs cannot reset the counters. The
client IP is taken from `X-Forwarded-For` only when `TRUSTED_PROXY_COUNT` names the
exact number of trusted proxies in front of the API (default `0` → `REMOTE_ADDR`,
which clients cannot spoof). Changing a password stamps `password_changed_at` and
invalidates every refresh token issued before the change. 2FA secrets are
Fernet-encrypted with a dedicated `TWO_FACTOR_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (empty → legacy
`SECRET_KEY`-derived key), and TOTP codes are single-use (timestep replay guard).

```

Periods are per-budget now, so there is no global "selected account" or "selected
period" context - the old `BudgetAccountContext` / `BudgetPeriodContext` were removed.
Period selection lives inside the Budget detail page.

### Data Fetching

TanStack Query manages server state; mutations invalidate the affected queries
(no optimistic writes, so computed balances stay honest).

```typescript
const { data } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['transactions', page, filters],
  queryFn: () => transactionsApi.getAll(params),
})
```

## Database Architecture

### Core Tables

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `users_user` | User accounts |
| `workspaces_workspace` / `_workspacemember` | Workspaces + membership/roles |
| `currencies_currency` / `workspaces_workspacecurrency` | Global catalog + per-workspace enablement |
| `accounts_account` | Money-holding accounts |
| `budgeting_budget` / `_period` / `_categorybudget` / `budget_currencies` | Budgets, periods (cadence-derived or custom), planned amounts, per-budget currency sets |
| `categories_category` | Budget-scoped categories |
| `transactions_transaction` | Income / expense / adjustment records |
| `transaction_items` | Ordered receipt line items |
| `transaction_attachments` | Receipt file metadata + extraction state |
| `transfers_transfer` | Money moved between accounts |
| `planned_transactions_plannedtransaction` | Scheduled transactions |

### Workspace-Scoped Queries

All workspace-scoped models expose `for_workspace()`:

```python
Transaction.objects.for_workspace(workspace_id).filter(type='expense')
```

Each model declares a `WORKSPACE_FILTER` giving the ORM path to the workspace.

#### List Endpoints Security Behavior

List endpoints return empty arrays rather than 404 when a filter references a resource
in another workspace, so IDs in other workspaces are not leaked. This is intentional -
do not change to 404.

## Environment Configuration

### Backend

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `POSTGRES_*` | Database connection |
| `REDIS_URL`, `CELERY_*` | Celery broker/result backend |
| `SECRET_KEY`, `JWT_SECRET_KEY` | Django + token signing |
| `TWO_FACTOR_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | 2FA secret encryption (Fernet; empty = derive from `SECRET_KEY`) |
| `TRUSTED_PROXY_COUNT` | Trusted reverse proxies for client-IP parsing (0 = ignore `X-Forwarded-For`) |
| `RATE_LIMIT_*` | Rate-limit thresholds/windows (per-IP and per-account) |
| `USE_S3_STORAGE`, `S3_*` | Object storage for attachments and static files; browser-facing URLs follow `S3_EXTERNAL_URL` |
| `PARSER_URL`, `PARSER_API_TOKEN` | Receipt parser (empty `PARSER_URL` disables extraction everywhere) |
| `DEMO_MODE` | Disable registration when true |
| `DEFAULT_LANGUAGE`, `DEFAULT_NUMBER_FORMAT` | Default UI language / number-format style for new users (registry-validated; see [i18n.md](i18n.md)) |

### Frontend

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `VITE_API_URL` | Backend API base URL |
| `VITE_DEMO_MODE` | Hide registration link when true |

## Deployment

`docker-compose.yml` runs: `db` (Postgres), `redis`, `storage` (S3-compatible),
`api`, `ui`, `worker`, `beat`, plus `node` (dev toolchain, `--profile tools`).
Every value - credentials, service hostnames, published ports - comes from
`.env` (see `example.env`).

For local development `./dev.sh up` runs only the backing services and
`./dev.sh backend` / `./dev.sh frontend` run the app - in their containers by
default, or on the host with `DEV_TARGET=host`. `./dev.sh up --full` runs the
whole stack in Docker, which is also how it deploys.

With `USE_S3_STORAGE` enabled, the `api` entrypoint collects backend static
files (the Django admin among them) into the static bucket, and browsers fetch
them from storage rather than the API. Static URLs are generated at render
time from `S3_EXTERNAL_URL` - host and scheme both (a scheme-less value falls
back to `https`), so an `http://` external URL yields plain-http asset URLs
that browsers block as mixed content on HTTPS pages. Changing `S3_EXTERNAL_URL`
only needs a backend restart - `api`, `worker`, and `beat` share one image and
read settings at startup - and no re-collectstatic: the stored objects are
unchanged, only the rendered URLs differ.

The receipt parser is external and fully optional: any service implementing
`docs/parser-contract.md` can serve it. With `PARSER_URL` unset, the backend
reports extraction as disabled and the UI hides every extraction affordance.
