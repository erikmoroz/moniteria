# Role-Based Permissions Matrix

This document describes the permission system and access control matrix for Denarly.

## Permission Layers

The application implements a four-layer security model:

```
Layer 1: Authentication (JWT Validation)
   └── Is this a valid user?

Layer 2: Workspace Membership
   └── Does user belong to target workspace?

Layer 3: Role-Based Permissions
   └── Does user's role allow this action?

Layer 4: Resource Ownership Validation
   └── Does resource belong to user's workspace?
```

## Role Hierarchy

| Role | Level | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **Owner** | 1 (Highest) | Full workspace control, can manage all members |
| **Admin** | 2 | Can manage members (with restrictions) and all data |
| **Member** | 3 | Can create/edit/delete budget data only |
| **Viewer** | 4 (Lowest) | Read-only access to all data |

## Backend Enforcement

All permissions are enforced server-side in Django Ninja endpoints:

```python
from common.auth import JWTAuth, WorkspaceJWTAuth
from common.permissions import require_role
from workspaces.models import ADMIN_ROLES, WRITE_ROLES

# Authentication + workspace validation (for workspace-scoped endpoints)
@router.get('/endpoint', auth=WorkspaceJWTAuth())
def endpoint(request):
    user = request.auth  # Authenticated User instance
    workspace_id = request.auth.current_workspace_id  # Guaranteed to be set
    
    # Use for_workspace() for queries
    transactions = Transaction.objects.for_workspace(workspace_id)

# Authentication only (for non-workspace endpoints)
@router.get('/workspaces', auth=JWTAuth())
def list_workspaces(request):
    return Workspace.objects.filter(members__user=request.auth)

# Role validation
membership = WorkspaceMember.objects.get(
    workspace_id=workspace_id,
    user=request.auth
)
if membership.role not in ADMIN_ROLES:
    raise HttpError(403, 'Insufficient permissions')

# Or use require_role helper
require_role(request.auth, workspace_id, WRITE_ROLES)
```

## Frontend Visibility

The frontend hides UI elements based on user role:

```typescript
const { canManageBudgetAccounts, canManageBudgetData, canManageMembers } = usePermissions();

// Button visibility
{canManageBudgetAccounts && <Button>Add Account</Button>}
{canManageBudgetData && <Button>Add Transaction</Button>}
{canManageMembers && <Button>Add Member</Button>}
```

## Error Responses

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 401 | Not authenticated (invalid/missing token) |
| 403 | Not authorized (insufficient permissions) |
| 404 | Resource not found (or access denied to hide existence) |

## Security Notes

1. **Zero Trust**: Every request validates authentication, workspace membership, and role permissions
2. **Resource Isolation**: Users cannot access resources from other workspaces
3. **Cascading Access**: Resources inherit workspace scope through relationships
4. **Audit Trail**: All data records track created_by and updated_by user IDs
