description: Celery task conventions for Owlgarth Finances — task structure, retry semantics, idempotency guards, service-to-task dispatch (direct .delay() and on_commit deferral), circular import avoidance. Use when creating or modifying Celery tasks (<app>/tasks.py) or wiring background jobs into services.

# Celery Task Conventions

Celery tasks live in `<app>/tasks.py` using `@shared_task`. `config/celery.py` calls `autodiscover_tasks()` after Django is fully set up, so module-level imports of Django models are safe — do not use function-body imports (except for the circular-import case below).

## Tasks Delegate to Services

**Tasks must delegate DB operations to service classes.** Never use `Model.objects.create()` or direct ORM writes in a task — call the corresponding service method. Tasks are a transport layer, not a business logic layer:

```python
@shared_task(
    bind=True,
    autoretry_for=(Exception,),
    max_retries=3,
    retry_backoff=True,
)
def execute_planned_transaction(self, planned_id):
    planned = PlannedTransaction.objects.filter(id=planned_id).first()
    if not planned or not planned.payment_date:
        return  # Permanent failure — no point retrying
    if planned.transaction_id:
        return  # Already processed (idempotency fast path)
    # ... transient checks that raise domain exceptions for retry ...
    TransactionService.update_period_balance(...)
```

## Dispatch Pattern

Call `task.delay()` directly at call sites — no wrapper methods. Import the task at module level in `services.py`:

```python
from planned_transactions.tasks import execute_planned_transaction

class PlannedTransactionService:
    @staticmethod
    @db_transaction.atomic
    def execute(user, workspace_id, planned_id):
        # ... validation, status update to 'done' ...
        execute_planned_transaction.delay(planned.id)
```

**Defer dispatch when the task reads what the transaction writes.** `.delay()` inside an atomic publishes the message before the commit; a worker on its own connection that beats the commit hits the task's not-found branch, which returns silently (permanent failure, no retry) - a permanently, silently skipped message. When the task consumes rows the current transaction writes, register the dispatch inside `on_commit` INSIDE the atomic:

```python
db_transaction.on_commit(lambda: execute_planned_transaction.delay(planned.id))
```

Django 6 semantics (verified against the Django source, not docs): callbacks registered inside a savepoint are discarded on savepoint rollback and fire on the outermost commit - so the single inside-the-atomic placement is correct on the standalone path (the method's atomic is outermost) and on savepoint paths (under an idempotency wrapper's outer transaction, a race-loss rollback discards the dispatch together with the row it would have referenced). Inline `.delay()` remains correct for tasks that do not read the transaction's rows (e.g. email sends), but those sites silently depend on their enclosing atomic being outermost - a future caller wrapping the method in an outer transaction reintroduces the race; check for outer atomics whenever touching a dispatch site. The deferral also means the synchronous response honestly reflects pre-worker state (e.g. `transaction_id: null` until the worker runs) - never add a `refresh_from_db()` after the dispatch; it cannot observe post-commit task effects. Testing idiom: `captureOnCommitCallbacks` (see the `backend-testing` skill).

**Service-to-task dispatch:** When a service method enqueues a task, keep the synchronous logic in a private `@staticmethod` (e.g., `_send_sync()`) and make the public method a thin dispatcher that calls `.delay()`:

```python
class EmailService:
    @staticmethod
    def send_email(to, subject, template_name, context):
        # Import inside method body to avoid circular imports (tasks.py → email.py → tasks.py)
        from common.tasks import send_email_task

        to = [to] if isinstance(to, str) else to
        send_email_task.delay(to, subject, template_name, context)
        return True

    @staticmethod
    def _send_sync(to, subject, template_name, context):
        """Actual synchronous logic — called by the task."""
```

**Circular import avoidance:** When a service and its task are in the same module chain (e.g., `common/tasks.py` imports from `common/email.py`), import the task inside the method body, not at module level.

## Retry Semantics

- **Transient failures** (may resolve on retry — e.g., missing period that could be created later): raise domain exceptions so `autoretry_for` retries.
- **Permanent failures** (missing record, missing required field): return silently to avoid infinite retries.

## Double Idempotency Guard

Check outside the lock (fast path for retries), then again inside `select_for_update()` (prevents race conditions):

```python
if planned.transaction_id:
    return  # Fast path — no lock needed
with db_transaction.atomic():
    planned = PlannedTransaction.objects.select_for_update().get(id=planned_id)
    if planned.transaction_id:
        return  # Slow path — locked, prevents race
```

## Testing

See the `backend-testing` skill — `CELERY_TASK_ALWAYS_EAGER=True` makes `.delay()` synchronous; call tasks directly in tests and use the three-class structure (direct invocation / service dispatch / config validation).
