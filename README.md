## ⚠️ Important Notices

### AI-Assisted Development

**This codebase contains code generated with the help of AI tools.** The application was developed using AI-assisted coding tools to accelerate development and explore modern development workflows.

### Developer's Note

This project started as a personal pet project to replace Excel spreadsheets for my personal budgeting needs. I wanted to test the capabilities of AI development tools while solving a real problem I had. The result exceeded my expectations, so I've decided to continue developing Moniteria as an open-source application.

In the next development phase, I plan to conduct deeper code reviews and refactoring to ensure code quality, maintainability, and adherence to best practices.
